## üß™ How to Run Tests

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sql
   mvn clean install
   ```
2. **Run a specific test runner:**
    ```sql
    mvn test -Dtest=ApplyLeaveTestRunner
    ```

3. **View Logs:**
- Console output for real-time feedback
- File logs at `../logs/test-automation.log` with daily rotation

4. **View Results:**
- Excel files updated in `src/test/resources/Trace/`
- Playwright traces saved as `.zip` files for detailed UI replay

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Logging Setup

- Logging is configured via `logback.xml` in `src/main/resources`
- Logs are written to:
- Console (all levels)
- File: `../logs/test-automation.YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- Old logs are rotated daily and kept for 14 days

---

## üìä Test Data & Results

- All test steps are defined in Excel files (`.xlsx`) under `src/test/resources/testdata/`
- Each row in the Excel represents one test step with:
- Scenario ID, Test Step, Selector, Input, Expected Output
- Results are written back into result files for analysis

---

## üìÇ Trace Artifacts

- Each test scenario generates a Playwright `.zip` trace:
- HTML snapshots
- Screenshots
- Action timeline
- Traces are saved in `src/test/resources/Trace/` for replay and debugging

---

## üîí Best Practices Followed

- Page Object + Action pattern
- Externalized test data (no hardcoded steps)
- Central config management via constants
- Clean separation between logic, test runners, and data
- Structured logging with log levels
- Reusable utilities for Excel I/O and file operations

## ü§ù Contribution & Maintenance

This framework is modular and extensible. You can add:
- New test modules by adding TestNG runners
- More Page Action classes for other tabs/pages
- API integrations, DB verifications, or visual validation

All configurations, logs, and test data are externalized to support scalable, maintainable, and robust test automation.
